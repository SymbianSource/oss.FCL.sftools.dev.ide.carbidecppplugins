*** INSTRUCTIONS TO THE TEMPLATE USER:

*** This template follows the S60 coding conventions
*** (S60_Coding_Conventions.doc).  Remove all unneeded declarations
*** and definitions before checking the file in!  Also remove the
*** template's usage instructions, that is, everything that begins
*** with "***".

*** The copyright years should be < the year of the file's creation >
*** - < the year of the file's latest update >.

*** Words that begin with "?" are for you to replace with your own
*** identifiers, filenames, or comments.

*** To support building on Linux, use only forward slashes in include
*** directives.  Also, all filenames and pathnames must be completely
*** in lowercase.

*** A line should not end with a backslash (\).  If it is absolutely
*** necessary to have a line end in a backslash, add a comment after
*** it, or some versions of the build system might think it's a
*** continuing line.

*** Indent four spaces per step, using spaces, not tabs, to display
*** the code consistently across different editors.


PRJ_PLATFORMS
*** Specify the platforms your component needs to be built for here.  Example:
DEFAULT

PRJ_EXPORTS
*** Specify the source file followed by its destination here
*** copy will be used to copy the source file to its destination
*** If there's no destination then the source file will be copied
*** to the same name in \epoc32\include.  Example:
..\inc\?headerfile.h
..\inc\?headerfile_2.h                   \epoc32\include\?path_somewhere_else\?headerfile_2.h
..\data\?inifile.ini                     \epoc32\data\c\private\?uid3\?inifile.ini
..\graphics\?qgn_myapp_icon_1.bmp        \s60\bitmaps2\?qgn_myapp_icon_1.bmp
..\graphics\?qgn_myapp_icon_1_mask.bmp   \s60\bitmaps2\?qgn_myapp_icon_1_mask.bmp
..\graphics\?qgn_myapp_icon_2.bmp        \s60\bitmaps2\?qgn_myapp_icon_2.bmp
..\graphics\?qgn_myapp_icon_2_mask.bmp   \s60\bitmaps2\?qgn_myapp_icon_2_mask.bmp

PRJ_MMPFILES
*** Icons are built using a makefile.  Example:
gnumakefile icons.mk
#ifdef __SCALABLE_ICONS
    // Remember to change the mk-file name to be unique within the
    // Architecture domain
    gnumakefile icons_aif_scalable.mk
#else
    // Remember to change the mk-file name to be unique within the
    // Architecture domain
    gnumakefile icons_aif_bitmaps.mk
#endif 
*** Specify the .mmp files required for building the important component
*** releasables. Specify "tidy" if the component you need to build doesn't
*** need to be released.  Example:
myproject.mmp
myhelpproject.mmp tidy
#if defined( MARM )
    myarmspecificproject.mmp
#endif

PRJ_TESTMMPFILES
*** Specify the .mmp files required for building any test programs here.
*** Example:
..\test\group\mytest.mmp

PRJ_TESTEXPORTS
*** Specify the files to be copied from the source directories to the
*** releasables' directories for use with test programs.  Example:
..\test\inc\mytestcommon.h     \epoc32\somewhere\mytestcommon.h
