/*
  The syntax of a logical name entry in this file is the following:

  // d:context description (line 1)
  // d:context description (line N)
  // l:layout id
  // w:
  // r:release information
  //
  #define qtn_<?feature_or_application>_?freetext "?text"

  where
      "qtn_" starts a logical name.  Note: "text_" has been used in
           old logical names, but is deprecated.
      "?feature/application" is 2-5 lower-case characters and/or numbers
           identifying the larger context of the display text.
      "?freetext" is the free text portion of the logical name.
           It may contain only lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), numbers
           ('0' to '9'), and the underscore ('_').  The total length of
           the logical name does must not exceed 50 characters.
      "d:" Starts a description line clarifying the entry's context with
           information like:
           - Is a word a verb in imperative or is it a noun?  (For instance,
             what does "Set" mean?)
           - What will replace %U (unicode text parameter) or %N (number
             parameter) included in texts?  (For instance, is it a phone
             number or an e-mail address?)
      "l:" Starts a layout id information (one line).
           "P" and "No" are symbols in LAF's information table
                - "P" is parent pane or current pane
                - "No" is reference number in table
      "r:" Starts a release information: one line indicating in which
           S60 release the text was used for the first time.

  Refer to the S60 localization instructions for more information.

  Examples:

// d:Command in options list in short term memories.
// d:Opens the call list view that is focused.
// l:list_single_popup_menu_pane_1
// r:3.1
//
#define text_logs_stm_cmd_open "Open"

// d:Title pane text in converter main state.
// l:title_pane_1
// r:3.0
//
#define qtn_cnv_title "Converter"

// d:Prompt text for currency data query in converter.
// l:popup_query_data_window_1
// r:4.0
//
#define qtn_cnv_edit_name_prompt "Currency name"

// d:Active call is terminated and a held call becomes active.
// d:Operation is confirmed with this info note.
// d:%U stands for the call identification of the activated call.
// l:popup_note_window_1
// r:3.1
//
#define qtn_multc_unhold_done_note "%U active"
