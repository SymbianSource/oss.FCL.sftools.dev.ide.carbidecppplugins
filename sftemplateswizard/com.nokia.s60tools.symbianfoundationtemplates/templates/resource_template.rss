*** INSTRUCTIONS TO THE TEMPLATE USER:

*** This template follows the Symbian Foundation coding conventions.
*** Remove all unneeded declarations and definitions before checking 
*** the file in!  Also remove the template's usage instructions, that is, 
*** everything that begins with "***".

*** The copyright years should be < the year of the file's creation >
*** - < the year of the file's latest update >.

*** Words that begin with "?" are for you to replace with your own
*** identifiers, filenames, or comments.

*** To support building on Linux, use only forward slashes in include
*** directives.  Also, all filenames and pathnames must be completely
*** in lowercase.

*** A line should not end with a backslash (\).  If it is absolutely
*** necessary to have a line end in a backslash, add a comment after
*** it, or some versions of the build system might think it's a
*** continuing line.

*** Indent four spaces per step, using spaces, not tabs, to display
*** the code consistently across different editors.
