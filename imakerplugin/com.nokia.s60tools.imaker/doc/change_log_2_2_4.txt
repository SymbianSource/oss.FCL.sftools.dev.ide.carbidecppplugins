Product Description:
====================
The iMaker extension for Carbide.c++ is a tool for building ROM images. Its core functionality is implemented in a command line executable called imaker.cmd. 
The iMaker offers a Carbide.c++ integration that provides a graphical user interface for the imaker.cmd command line tool. The iMaker enables you to set and 
modify the build parameters that are used by iMaker.

Image building process is started by launching iMaker dialog by choosing the Open iMaker Dialog... menu item from iMaker pulldown menu (hammer with 'i') on the Carbide.c++ toolbar.
The ROM image is built using the preferences configured in this dialog. Although not necessary, these preferences can be saved for future use for image building if needed. 
Once preferences are configured, an image can be built by clicking the Run button in the dialog.
