<body><h2>Getting Started</h2> <p>The iMaker extension for Carbide.c++
is a tool for building ROM images. In the future also for flashing images to the end device. The information in this section
will help you get started quickly using the basic features of iMaker.</p><p>
Before you can create images with the iMaker, the following conditions
must be met:</p><ul>
<li>An active project in the Carbide.c++ workspace must exist. The project must be located
 on the top of a working build environment (an S60 3rd edition R&amp;D SDK or higher)</li>
</ul><p>Build ROM images by following these steps:</p><ol>
<li><a href="tasks/taskPreferences.html">Build image via iMaker Dialog</a>.</li>
<li><a href="tasks/build_image.html#select_prev">Build image via saved preferences</a>.</li>
</ol>  <p>While the image is being built, a build log can be seen in the console in Carbide.c++.</p>  <div id="footer">Copyright &copy; 2009 Nokia Corporation and/or its subsidiary(-ies).
