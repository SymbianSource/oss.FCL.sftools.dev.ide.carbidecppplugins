<body><h2>iMaker build tool</h2> <p>iMaker is an image creation tool that
provides a simple, standardized and configurable image creation framework.
iMaker is based on the standardized Make system, which makes it platform-independent.</p>
<p>iMaker creates a FlashImage from a set of Symbian OS binary and data files. The tool mainly functions on top of the Symbian OS <i>buildrom</i> utility. The iMaker tool itself runs the Make tool and consists of a thin
layer of Perl.</p>  <div id="footer">Copyright &copy; 2009 Nokia Corporation and/or its subsidiary(-ies). All rights reserved. License: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>.</div>
