<h3>Basic walk-through</h3>
<p>You can start the Creator Carbide.c++ Extension by selecting <b>File > New > Other > Carbide Extensions > Creator script file</b> or <b>Carbide > Creator Script Editor</b>.</p>
<p>The basic steps for using Creator are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../tasks/creating_xml_file.htm">Create the script file</a> as part of your project in Carbide.c++. </li>
<li><a href="../tasks/adding_components.htm">Add components</a> (for example, contacts, messages, to-do items) into the script.</li>
<li><a href="../tasks/run_in_device.htm">Upload the <i>.creatorxml</i> script file to a target device and run the script in the device</a>, or just send the <i>.creatorxml</i> file to the device (for example, via a Bluetooth or USB cable connection) and run it using the Creator S60 device application.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can edit scripts in the Creator tool at any time by modifying the component data or removing one or more components. For instructions, see <a href="../tasks/modifying_components.htm">Modifying components</a>.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Script files that have already been created are listed in the Project Explorer view of your workspace. In this case, you can also start the tool by right-clicking the XML file and selecting <b>Open With > Creator Script Editor</b>.</p>
