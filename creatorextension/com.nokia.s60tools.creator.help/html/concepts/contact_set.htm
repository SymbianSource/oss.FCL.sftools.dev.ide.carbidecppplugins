<h2>Contact set</h2>
<p>In Creator, <i>contact set</i> is a technical term that is not visible on actual S60 devices. Contact sets can be created for associating contacts with contact groups, message items and calendar items. For creating new Contact sets, there is an <b>Add new Contact-set</b> button in the Creator Script Editor.</p>
<p>The practical use of the contact set element is to enable the creation of advanced test data combinations. You can, for example, associate contacts as senders or recipients of a message, or associate them as the attendees in an appointment entry. You can create as many contact sets as needed for different purposes. Each contact set is identified by a unique ID number that is generated automatically. See the following figure for an example:</p>
