<h3><a name="description"></a>Product description</h3>
<p>The Creator tool is used to create different kinds of test data (for example, contacts, messages or calendar entries) into a device. Creator is a useful tool for testing situations where a device is saving high amounts of data, or the data is either saved to a device several times or to multiple devices at the same time. </p>
<p>The test data itself is contained in XML scripts, identified by the <i>.creatorxml</i> file extension. The Creator Carbide.c++ Extension automates and simplifies the creation of these scripts by enabling you to add components such as contacts, messages, notes, and files in the Carbide IDE. You can also create advanced test data combinations that associate, for example, contact data with messaging data. </p>
<p>The Creator extension can be started by selecting <b>File > New > Other > Carbide Extensions > Creator script file</b> or <b>Carbide > Creator Script Editor</b>.</p>
