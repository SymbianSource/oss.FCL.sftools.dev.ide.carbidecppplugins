<h2>Transferring files with Remote Control</h2>
<p>After you start Carbide.c++ and the Datagateway for the first time, the root folder structure of the target device is displayed. Newer versions of <b>HTI Framework</b> (versions 1.88, 1.89, 2.1 and newer) also support the display of drive, folder, and file sizes.</p>

<p>To navigate to the folder you want to work with, either double-click the folder icons, or enter the folder path in the <b>Path</b> field and press <i>Enter</i> or click <b>Go to directory</b>. You can enter a whole folder path such as <i>C:\Data\Images</i>, and you can use <i>..\</i> to move up in the folder structure.</p>

<p>To transfer files, use the <a href="../reference/toolbar.htm">toolbar buttons</a> or right-click in the File Transfer mode, and select a function from the context menu. The dynamic context menu contains the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New folder</b> creates a new folder under the selected folder.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> deletes the selected file(s) and folder(s).</li>
<li><b>Download</b> transfers the selected files from the device to the PC. You cannot download folders.</li>
<li><b>Download as</b> transfer the selected file from the device to the PC and lets you define a name and location for the file. Note that Download as lets you download only a single file. You cannot download folders.</li>
<li><b>Upload</b> transfers the selected files from the PC to the device. You cannot upload folders.</li>
<li><b>Open</b> transfers the selected files from the device to the PC and opens them in Carbide.c++. You cannot download folders.</li>
<li><b>Copy</b> copies the selected files and folders. Copy is supported in HTI Framework versions 1.91, 2.5 or newer.</li>
<li><b>Cut</b> cuts the selected files and folders. Cut is supported in HTI Framework versions 1.91, 2.5 or newer.</li>
<li><b>Paste</b> pastes the selected files and folders to the current location. Paste is supported in HTI Framework versions 1.91, 2.5 or newer.</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> renames the selected file or folder. Rename is supported in HTI Framework versions 1.91, 2.5 or newer.</li>
<li><b>Preferences</b> open the Remote Control Preferences dialog.</li>
<li><b>Refresh</b> load the folder structure and contents again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the dynamic context menu only contain functions that are allowed for the selected file or folder.</p>

<p><b>Tip</b>: You can also drag and drop files from Windows Explorer to the Remote Control File Transfer view.</p>

<p>When uploading or downloading a file that already exists in the target folder, you are asked to confirm the file replace. In this dialog, you can turn off this warning by selecting <b>Always replace withouth prompt</b>. You can also rename the file by clicking <b>Rename</b>.
